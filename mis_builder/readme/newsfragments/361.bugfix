When on a MIS Report Instance, if you wanted to generate a new line of type comparison, you couldn't currently select any existing period to compare.
This happened because the field domain was searching in a NewId context, thus not finding a correct period.
Changing the domain and making it use a computed field with a search for the _origin record solves the problem.
